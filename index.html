<h2>The City Of Ottawa Is Committed To Helping Children Swim Safely</h2>

<p>Drowning is the second leading cause of preventable death for children under 7. In Surrey, our goal is to expose children to the water in a safe and fun environment. Through safety knowledge and experience, we can help ensure your children have a safe and enjoyable swim.</p>

<p>Working in partnership with the Lifesaving Society of Ottawa helps kids improve their comfort in the water. Swimming lessons provide skills for safety. Through our registered and drop-in lessons, our instructors can help.<p>

<p><strong>Open water safety</strong></p>

<p>Swimming in open water creates challenges unique to the outdoor setting. See information about our community pool swimming area for quick tips on indoor water safety.</p>
